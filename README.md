# portfolio

After the Pandemic, with so much of our lives switching to an online platform, it became harder and harder to shake hands with people when you met them, to give them a smile or meet them at a cafe. I made this portfolio to move my introduction online: now, instead of handing out resumes I could send this link instead. 

The majority of this project uses HTML, while the background works are written using Python. HTML was not the focus of this project, because of which I used online templates. The main goal was to link each page using python and to get information that the viewers input from the contact page directly to me.
